# SecureBank-Penetration-Test-
Comprehensive security audit revealing 15 critical vulnerabilities in banking infrastructure
# üîê SecureBank Penetration Test

A comprehensive penetration test simulating real-world attacks on a fictional banking platform. This project uncovered **15 critical vulnerabilities** across web, network, and application layers ‚Äî emphasizing the importance of layered security in financial systems.

## üß† Objective

To assess the security posture of **SecureBank**, a mock online banking system, by simulating black-box attacks and documenting all findings, methods, and remediation strategies. This project was executed as part of a cybersecurity research initiative.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

| Tool           | Purpose                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Kali Linux** | Main pentesting OS                   |
| **Nmap**       | Network scanning & service discovery |
| **Burp Suite** | Web application proxy and analysis   |
| **Metasploit** | Exploitation framework               |
| **OWASP ZAP**  | Vulnerability scanning & automation  |

## üïµÔ∏è Methodology

Follows the **OWASP Testing Guide** and **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)**:

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Passive and active footprinting using WHOIS, DNS, and Nmap
2. **Scanning & Enumeration**
   - Port scanning, banner grabbing, and web crawling
3. **Exploitation**
   - Web app attacks (e.g., SQLi, IDOR, XSS)
   - Network-level attacks
4. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Privilege escalation simulation
   - Session hijacking
5. **Reporting**
   - Documented 15 critical vulnerabilities and fixes

## üí• Key Vulnerabilities Discovered

| Vulnerability                  | Impact                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **SQL Injection**             | Full DB access; credential leakage       |
| **Broken Authentication**     | Session hijacking; account takeover      |
| **IDOR (Access Control Flaws)** | Unauthorized access to sensitive data  |
| **Open Admin Panel**          | Unauthenticated admin access             |
| **Insecure Session Tokens**   | Predictable tokens; easy to forge        |
| **Lack of Rate Limiting**     | Brute-force attack feasibility           |
| **Verbose Error Messages**    | Information leakage                      |
| **Misconfigured SSL/TLS**     | Weak cipher suites, missing HSTS         |
| **Clickjacking**              | UI Redress vulnerability                 |
| ...and more (15 total)
